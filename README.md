## 🧩 About the Project

**SKY AI** is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the machine learning workflow for both beginners and experts. From data visualization to model training and performance analysis, SKY AI guides users through every step in an intuitive and interactive way.

This platform allows users to:

- Upload datasets (CSV/Excel).
- Visualize data patterns.
- Generate detailed reports.
- Clean and preprocess data.
- Train ML and deep learning models.
- Evaluate model performance visually.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, 3D visualizations.
- **Comprehensive Data Reports**: Missing values, outliers, correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing Tools**: Scaling, encoding, handling missing values.
- **Model Training Options**:
  - Traditional ML Models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
  - Deep Learning Models (Keras/TensorFlow)
- **Performance Analysis**: Confusion matrix, accuracy charts, error distribution.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Upload Data**: Drag & drop CSV or Excel files.
2. **Explore Data**: Interactive plots and summary statistics.
3. **Generate Report**: Get insights about missing values, outliers, and correlations.
4. **Clean Data**: Apply preprocessing steps like imputation, scaling, and encoding.
5. **Train Model**: Choose between ML or DL models.
6. **Evaluate Model**: View metrics and visualizations of model performance.
